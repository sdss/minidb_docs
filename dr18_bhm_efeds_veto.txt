Summary
-------
The BHM-SPIDERS eFEDS veto catalogue.

A minimalist catalogue of 6300 science targets in the SPIDERS eFEDS field that received SDSS-IV spectroscopy during the March2020 SPIDERS observing run (and hence are not in SDSS-SpecObj-DR16). Many of these spectra have very low SNR and so we will want to observe them again, but we will take account of this in the Carton code. This is a subset (in both rows and columns) of the spAll-v5_13_1.fits idlspec2d pipeline product. The original data model for that file is here: https://data.sdss.org/datamodel/files/BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX/RUN2D/spAll.html
