Summary
-------
Contains merged sources for every field in the SuperCOSMOS Science Archive (SSA).
It consists of data from digitised sky survey plates taken with the UK Schmidt
telescope (UKST), the ESO Schmidt, and the Palomar Schmidt.
Each field within the SSA is covered by four plates in passbands B, R and
I with R being covered twice at different times. This results in
four-plate multi-colour, multi-epoch data which are merged into a single
source catalogue for general science exploitation. This table contains the
associated merged records created from the records in table Detection,
along with a full astrometric solution (including proper motions) computed
from the available position measures. The most useful subset of image
morphological descriptors are also propagated into this table for ease of
use.
