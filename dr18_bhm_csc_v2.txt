Summary
-------

CSC2 X-ray sources that have been matched
separately to PanSTARRS-1, Gaia DR2, and 2MASS catalogs, using the programs NWAY
(Johannes Buchner; see: Salvato 2018, MN, 473, 4937) and Xmatch (Arnold Rots; see:
https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/csc/csc_crossmatches.html). Both are based on the Bayesian spatial
cross-matching algorithm developed by Budavari & Szalay (2008, ApJ 679, 301), but Xmatch
has the added capability of taking source extent and/or PSF into account.
Created March 2021 by Paul Green, Dong-Woo Kim, Arnold Rots and the CXC CatSci group.

Columns
-------

cxoid - CSC2 Chandra ID

ocat - optical catalog code (P for PS1, G for Gaia)
oid - object ID from optical catalog
ora - optical magnitude from optical catalog [mag]
odec - right ascension (2000) from optical catalog [deg]
omag - declination (2000) from optical catalog [deg]
omatchtype - X-ray/optical match type (1-4 definite/likely/multiple opt, multiple X)
