Summary
-------

A 'targeting_generation' describes a collection of versioned cartons, together with their robostrategy control parameters. This is a convenient way to describe the specific set of carton-versions that were used (and the way that they were treated) within any particular run of robostrategy.  The dr19_targeting_generation_to_carton table describes a many-to-many relationship, connecting each targeting_generation to a set of entries in the dr19_carton table, as well as recording how those carton-versions were treated in the robostrategy code (i.e. the rs_stage and rs_active parameters).  Taken together, the dr19_targeting_generation, dr19_targeting_generation_to_carton and dr19_targeting_generation_to_version tables duplicate, in a database form, the robostrategy carton configuration information available via the rsconfig product (https://github.com/sdss/rsconfig). 

Columns
-------

pk - primary key for this table entry
generation_pk - primary key of an entry in the dr19_targeting_generation table
carton_pk - primary key of an entry in the dr19_carton table, i.e. a carton-version
rs_stage - the algorithimic stage of robostrategy in which targets from this carton-version are considered for assignment. Options: 'none', 'plates', 'srd', 'filler', or 'open'. See the robostrategy documentation for further information. 
rs_active - a Boolean column describing whether the carton-version is considered within robostrategy
