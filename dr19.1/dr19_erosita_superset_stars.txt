Summary
-------

One of several tables describing optical/IR counterparts to eROSITA X-ray sources identified via various methods.  These tables contain a superset of potential targets from which the SDSS-V spectroscopic targets were drawn.  The dr19_erosita_superset_stars table includes counterparts to point-like X-ray sources, chosen via an algorithm optimised to select coronally active stars.  Each row corresponds to one possible match between an X-ray source and a potential optical/IR counterpart.  The X-ray columns (ero_*) record the eROSITA information known at the time of target selection and may differ from publicly available eROSITA catalogs. The dr19_erosita_superset_* tables are derived from a combination of eROSITA's first 6-month survey of of the West Galactic hemisphere ('eRASS1'), and from the eROSITA observations of the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth performance verification field ('eFEDS').

Columns
-------

ero_version - Identifier giving the eROSITA dataset and processing version e.g. 'eFEDS_c940', 'em01_c946_201008_poscorr' etc 
ero_detuid -  The standard official eROSITA unique detection identifier, e.g. 'em01_123456_020_ML12345_001_c946' etc 
ero_flux -  X-ray flux, usually in the main eROSITA detection band (0.2-2.3keV) [erg/cm2/s]
ero_morph -  X-ray morphological classification ("POINTLIKE" or "EXTENDED") 
ero_det_like -  X-ray detection likelihood 
ero_ra - Best determination of X-ray position (J2000) [deg]
ero_dec -  Best determination of X-ray position (J2000) [deg]
ero_radec_err -  Best estimate of X-ray position uncertainty [arcsec]
xmatch_method - The X-ray-to-optical/IR cross-match method that was used in this case e.g. 'XPS-ML/NWAY', 'CLUSTERS_EFEDS_MULTIPLE' etc 
xmatch_version - The cross-match software version and OIR catalog used e.g. 'LSdr8-JWMS_v2.1LSdr8-JWMS_v2.1', 'LSdr8-AG_v1,JC_16032020', 'eromapper_2020-10-12', 'CW20ps1dr2-v011220' etc 
xmatch_dist -  Distance between X-ray position and optical counterpart [arcsec] 
xmatch_metric -  Metric giving quality of cross-match. Meaning is dependent on xmatch_method, e.g. p_any for NWAY 
xmatch_flags -  Flags indicating cross-match properties (e.g. status flags), xmatch_method dependent 
target_class - Best guess of source classification at time of xmatch e.g. 'GALAXY','STAR','QSO','UNKNOWN',.... 
target_priority -  Relative to other targets in this catalog, interpreted/adapted later to derive a final target priority 
target_has_spec -  Flags used to indicate if target has good quality archival spectroscopy available 
opt_cat - Describes which OIR survey provided the optical counterpart for this row of the table, i.e. which OIR cat gives the entries in fields opt_ra, opt_dec, opt_pmra, opt_pmdec, opt_epoch, and which OIR identifier is given in the *_id columns 
ls_id - Identifier of counterpart (if any) in dr19_legacy_survey_dr8 ('ls_id' field). Arithmetically derived from legacysurvey sweep file columns: release, brickid and objid:  ls_id = objid + (brickid * 2**16) + (release * 2**40) 
ps1_dr2_id - Identifier of counterpart (if any) in dr19_panstarrs1 (catid_objid field). Identical to MAST 'ippObjID' identifier 
gaia_dr2_id - Identifier of counterpart (if any) in dr19_gaia_dr2_source ('source_id' field) 
catwise2020_id -  Identifier of counterpart (if any) in dr19_catwise2020 ('source_id' field) 
skymapper_dr2_id -  Identifier of counterpart (if any) in dr19_skymapper_dr2 ('object_id' field) 
supercosmos_id -  Identifier of counterpart (if any) in dr19_supercosmos ('objid' field) 
tycho2_id -  Identifier of counterpart (if any) in dr19_tycho2 ('designation' field) 
sdss_dr13_id -  Identifier of counterpart (if any) in dr19_sdss_dr13_photoobj ('objid' field) 
opt_ra - Sky coordinate of optical/IR counterpart, included for validity checks only [deg]
opt_dec - Sky coordinate of optical/IR counterpart, included for validity checks only [deg]
opt_pmra - Proper motion of optical/IR counterpart, included for validity checks only [mas/yr] 
opt_pmdec - Proper motion of optical/IR counterpart, included for validity checks only [mas/yr]
opt_epoch - Epoch of opt_ra,opt_dec [decimal year]
pkey - primary key of table entry
