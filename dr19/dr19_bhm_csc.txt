Summary
-------

Chandra Source Catalogue version 2.0 (CSC2) sources that have been matched (separately) to the PanSTARRS-1 and 2MASS catalogs.  This version of the CSC2 catalog informed early (plate era) SDSS-V observations but was then replaced by updated versions.

Columns
-------

pk - primary key of this table entry
