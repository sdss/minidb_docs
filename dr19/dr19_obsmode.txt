Summary
-------

The table contains observing constraints for different observing modes. Cadences have an observing mode associated with each epoch, and the constraints are checked before an epoch can be scheduled.


Columns
-------

label - Descriptive name for the observing mode, e.g. 'dark_rm' []
min_moon_sep - Minimum distance a target must be from the Moon [deg]
min_deltav_ks91 - Minimum estimated background flux from the Moon, using the method of Krisciunas, K., & Schaefer 1991 [mag]
min_twilight_ang - Minimum twilight angle (angle of the Sun below the horizon) for a target to be observed [deg]
max_airmass_apo - Max airmass at which a target can be observed at APO
max_airmass_lco - Max airmass at which a target can be observed at LCO
