target_pk - The primary key. A sequential identifier. []
ra - The right ascension of the target in ICRS coordinates at epoch. From dr18_catalog. [degree]
dec - The declination of the target in ICRS coordinates at epoch. From dr18_catalog. [degree]
pmra - The proper motion in right ascenscion of the target, as a true angle. From dr18_catalog. [mas/yr]
pmdec - The proper motion in declination of the target. From dr18_catalog. [mas/yr]
