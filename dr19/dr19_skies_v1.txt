Summary
-------

This table stores the positions used as blank sky regions for DR19 targetting.

The sky regions are selected by dividing the sky in tiles of HEALpix nside 32. Each tile is then subdivided in candidate regions of HEALpix nside 32768 and the pixels that meet the isolation requirements are considered valid skies. This process is repeated for a number of all-sky catalogues. See <a href="https://sdss.org/dr19/targeting/fps/sky/"> for further details of the process by which suitable sky locations are selected in SDSS-V/FPS. This version of the skies catalog was used for v0.1 target selection. The skies_v2 catalog was used for v0.5 and subsequent target selections.


Columns
-------

pix_32768 - The HEALpix pixel (nside=32768, nested indexing, Equatorial coords) of the sky region. []
ra - The RA of the centre of the sky pixel. [degrees]
dec - The declination of the centre of the sky pixel. [degrees]
down_pix - The HEALpix pixel (nside=256, nested indexing, Equatorial coords) of the sky region. Used internally to downsample the list of candidate region. []
tile_32 -The HEALpix pixel (nside=32, nested indexing, Equatorial coords) of the sky region. []
gaia_sky - Whether this is a valid sky region in the Gaia DR2 catalogue. []
sep_neighbour_gaia - Separation to the nearest Gaia DR2 neighbour. [arcsec]
mag_neighbour_gaia - Magnitude of the nearest Gaia DR2 neighbour (G band, Vega). [mag]
ls8_sky - Whether this is a valid sky region in the Legacy Survey DR8 catalogue. []
sep_neighbour_ls8 - Separation to the nearest Legacy Survey DR8 neighbour. [arcsec]
mag_neighbour_ls8 - Magnitude of the nearest Legacy Survey DR8 neighbour (r-band, AB). [mag]
tmass_sky - Whether this is a valid sky region in the 2MASS point source catalogue. []
sep_neighbour_tmass - Separation to the nearest 2MASS point source neighbour. [arcsec]

tycho2_sky - Whether this is a valid sky region in the Tycho2 catalogue. []
sep_neighbour_tycho2 - Separation to the nearest Tycho2 neighbour. [arcsec]
mag_neighbour_tycho2 - Magnitude of the nearest Tycho2 neighbour (Vt band, Vega). [mag]
tmass_xsc_sky - Whether this is a valid sky region in the 2MASS extended source catalogue. []
sep_neighbour_tmass_xsc - Separation to the nearest 2MASS extended source neighbour [arcsec]
