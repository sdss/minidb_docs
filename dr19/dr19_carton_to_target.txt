Summary
-------

The table stores the targets assigned to a given carton along with information about the instrument that will observe that target, and offsetting data.


Columns
-------

carton_to_target_pk - The primary key. A sequential identifier.
lambda_eff - The effective wavelength at which the object will be observed [angstrom]
carton_pk - The primary key of the carton in the dr19_carton table.
target_pk - The primary key of the target in the dr19_target table.
cadence_pk - The primary key of the cadence in the dr19_cadence table.
priority - The target priority. Used for scheduling.
value - An internal metric of the target value used for scheduling.
instrument_pk - The primary key of the instrument in the dr19_instrument table.
delta_ra - The RA offset for fibre positioning, in arcsec.
delta_dec - The Dec offset for fibre positioning, in arcsec.
inertial - Whether this is an inertial target (no proper motion will be applied).
