Summary
-------

This table contains the best matched associations between SDSS identifiers (sdss_id, catalogid) and the unique identifiers in the parent catalogues used for SDSS cross-matches.

The format of the parent catalogue columns is <table_name>__<column_name>, where <column_name> is the primary key/unique identifier column to which to join in the dr19_<table_name> table.
