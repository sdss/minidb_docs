Summary
-------

This table stores the positions used as blank sky regions for dr19 targetting. The sky regions are selected by dividing the sky in tiles of HEALpix nside 32. Each tile is then subdivided in candidate regions of HEALpix nside 32768 and the pixels that meet the isolation requirements are considered valid skies. This process is repeated for a number of all-sky catalogues. See <a href="https://sdss.org/dr19/targeting/fps/sky/"> for further details of the process by which suitable sky locations are selected in SDSS-V/FPS.


Columns
-------

pix_32768 - The HEALpix pixel (nside=32768, nested indexing, Equatorial coords) of the sky region. []
ra - The RA of the centre of the sky pixel. [degrees]
dec - The declination of the centre of the sky pixel. [degrees]
down_pix - The HEALpix pixel (nside=256, nested indexing, Equatorial coords) of the sky region. Used internally to downsample the list of candidate region. []
