Summary
-------

A 'targeting_generation' describes a collection of versioned cartons,
together with their robostrategy control parameters. This is a convenient
way to describe the specific set of carton-versions that were used
(and the way that they were treated) within any particular run of
robostrategy.

The dr19_targeting_generation table contains all targeting_generations
that were considered for observations in the timespan covered by the
DR19 data release. In addition, we include the 'v0.5.3' targeting_generation
since this was the version released as part of DR18.

During the initial plate operations phase of SDSS-V, we did not use
the robostrategy code to assign fibers to targets. However, for
completeness, the 'v0.plates' pseudo-targeting_generation has been
reverse engineered in order to describe the set of carton-versions
that were considered during that phase.

The dr19_targeting_generation table can be joined
to the dr19_carton table via the dr19_targeting_generation_to_carton
table. To associate a targeting_generation with a robostrategy plan,
join dr19_targeting_generation to dr19_targetdb_version via the
dr19_targeting_generation_to_version table.

Taken together, the dr19_targeting_generation,
dr19_targeting_generation_to_carton and
dr19_targeting_generation_to_version tables duplicate, in a database
form, the robostrategy carton configuration information available
via the rsconfig product (https://github.com/sdss/rsconfig).
