Summary
-------

This table includes associations between sdss_id identifiers and the matched catalogids for each catalogue cross-match. The table contains one row per sdss_id with columns for each catalogid version. However, catalogids may be associated with multiple sdss_id. dr19_sdss_id_flat is a pivoted/flattened version of this table and contains information about the preferred sdss_id for a catalogid.

Note: The sdss_id match was extended internally for a more recent crossmatch not yet part of the publicly released data. As such, the ra/dec_sdss_id columns may differ from the catalogid coordinates.

Columns
-------

catalogid21 - The catalogid for the best matched object in the v0.1 cross-match (pk=21).
catalogid25 - The catalogid for the best matched object in the v0.5 cross-match (pk=25).
ra_sdss_id - The right ascension of the target in ICRS J2015.5 coordinates (taken from the highest version catalogid).
dec_sdss_id - The declination of the target in ICRS J2015.5 coordinates (taken from the highest version catalogid).
sdss_id - The SDSS identifier for a unique object.
last_updated - Calendar date when the association was last updated.
