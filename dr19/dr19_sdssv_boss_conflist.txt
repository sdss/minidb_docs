Summary
-------

The dr19_sdssv_boss_conflist table is a database representation of an
early version of the SDSS-V BOSS fieldlist data product.  The
dr19_sdssv_boss_conflist table was used within early iterations of FPS
target_selection as a way to communicate information about which
SDSS-V plates had been observed by the time of target selection.
This information was used
to e.g. de-prioritise targets that were expected to have a good quality
spectroscopic measurement before the start of SDSS-V FPS operations.

Caution. The dr19_sdssv_boss_conflist table should only be used in order to
recreate the target_selection selection function.

Column descriptions are mainly derived from: https://data.sdss.org/datamodel/files/BOSS_SPECTRO_REDUX/RUN2D/platelist.html
