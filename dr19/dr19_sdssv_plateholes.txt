Summary
-------

The combination of the dr19_sdssv_plateholes and dr19_plateholes_meta
tables are a database representation of the SDSS-V platelist data
product (https://svn.sdss.org/public/data/sdss/platelist/trunk/).
These tables were used within early iterations of FPS target_selection
as a way to communicate information about which targets had been
included in SDSS-V plates. This information was used to
e.g. de-prioritise targets that were expected to have a good quality
spectroscopic measurement by the end of the SDSS-V plate observations.
The dr19_sdssv_plateholes_meta table contains meta-data for each
SDSS-V plate (one record per plate), whereas the dr19_sdssv_plateholes
table has one entry for each drilled hole in each SDSS-V plate.
The dr19_sdssv_plateholes and dr19_plateholes_meta tables should be joined via the yanny_uid field.

Mostly derived from: https://data.sdss.org/datamodel/files/PLATELIST_DIR/designs/DESIGNID6XX/DESIGNID6/plateDesign.html

Columns
-------

holetype - type of hole to be drilled; one of SDSS, BOSS, MARVELS, APOGEE, GUIDE, CENTER, TRAP, or ALIGNMENT; this really refers to the instrument to be used, so for example SEGUE targets should be either SDSS or BOSS
targettype - type of target; one of SCIENCE, STANDARD, or SKY (if holetype is BOSS, SDSS, MARVELS or APOGEE); NA if not holetype is not one of the instruments (GUIDE, CENTER, TRAP, ALIGNMENT)
sourcetype - indicate the nature of the source, one of STAR, QSO, GALAXY, or NA (if targettype is NA)
target_ra - right ascension, in J2000 deg
target_dec - declination, in J2000 deg
iplateinput - integer indicating which plateInput file from the list in the plateDefinition file this came from (1-indexed); -1 or 0 if the hole wasn't from a plateInput file.
pointing - which pointing (1-indexed) this target is associated with; note this means which pointing among the ones that this plate is designed for, so if this a single pointing plate but uses the B-side MARVELS fibers, this will be "1", not "2"
offset_integer - which offset this target is associated with; 0 means it is not associated with an offset, it is associated with the primary pointing
fiberid - what fiber on the appropriate instrument (as listed in holetype) is assigned to this target (-9999 for none)
block - which fiber block that fiber is associated with (-9999 for none)
iguide - for guide holes, which guide fiber it is assigned to (from 1 to 11) (-9999 for non guide holes)
xf_default - X position of hole in focal plane, given a default set of observing parameters (hour angle of zero, temperature of 5 deg C), in units of mm; for position angle of zero (which we always use), +X is +RA
yf_default - Y position of hole in focal plane, given a default set of observing parameters (hour angle of zero, temperature of 5 deg C), in units of mm; for position angle of zero (which we always use), +Y is +Dec
lambda_eff - wavelength to optimize hole location for, in Angstroms (platedesign will default to 5400 if not set)
zoffset - backstopping offset distance, in microns (platedesign will default to 0 if not set)
bluefiber - 1 if the BOSS instrument is meant to assign this target a "blue" fiber; 0 otherwise
chunk - BOSS chunk number (0 if not appropriate)
ifinal - 0-indexed position in BOSS final tiling file (-1 if not appropriate)
origfile - for BOSS targets, name of file that target originated within (for BOSS targets, one of the bosstarget files, for ancillary targets, a file within the directory.
fileindx - for BOSS targets, 0-indexed position within ORIGFILE (-1 if not appropriate)
diameter - diameter of hole to be drilled, in mm
buffer - buffer to leave around hole edge for conflicts in mm
priority - priority number assigned by the plateInput file; lower numbers indicate higher priority
assigned - 1 if this was a target assigned to a fiber, 0 otherwise; clearly for all targets this will be 1 for plateDesign files, but this will not be the case for plateInput-output files, which also have this same format.
conflicted - 1 if this was a target not assigned because of a collision, 0 otherwise; clearly for all targets this will be 0 for plateDesign files, but this will not be the case for plateInput-output files, which also have this same format.
ranout - 1 if this was a target not assigned because we ran out of fibers, 0 otherwise; clearly for all targets this will be 0 for plateDesign files, but this will not be the case for plateInput-output files, which also have this same format.
outside - 1 if this was a target not assigned because it was too fare from the plate center, 0 otherwise; clearly for all targets this will be 0 for plateDesign files, but this will not be the case for plateInput-output files, which also have this same format.
