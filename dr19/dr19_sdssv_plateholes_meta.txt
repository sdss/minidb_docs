Summary
-------

The combination of the dr19_sdssv_plateholes and dr19_plateholes_meta
tables are a database representation of the SDSS-V platelist data
product (https://svn.sdss.org/public/data/sdss/platelist/trunk/).
These tables were used within early iterations of FPS target_selection
as a way to communicate information about which targets had been
included in SDSS-V plates. This information was used to
e.g. de-prioritise targets that were expected to have a good quality
spectroscopic measurement by the end of the SDSS-V plate observations.
The dr19_sdssv_plateholes_meta table contains meta-data for each
SDSS-V plate (one record per plate), whereas the dr19_sdssv_plateholes
table has one entry for each drilled hole in each SDSS-V plate.
The dr19_sdssv_plateholes and dr19_plateholes_meta tables should be
joined via the yanny_uid field.

Mostly derived from: https://data.sdss.org/datamodel/files/PLATELIST_DIR/plates/PLATEID6XX/PLATEID6/plateHoles.html
